The Grade I deserve is an 8 because at first I must say that I truly did my best on the exercise.
I think I achieved quite a lot with my basic skills, although that might not seem much for a pro. 
I think I now know how the GitHub looks and works and I could find my way around now, also when sharing repositories for the final/personal project together with my partner.

Here you see my profile, including the repositories I made (crazy_bioinformatics, craziest_bioinformatics), and the repositories I forked or contributed to
